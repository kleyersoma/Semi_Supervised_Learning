# Introduction to Semi Supervised Learning

This repository is a summary of the topics Semi Supervised Learning and Advanced Semi Supervised Learning from the book Mastering Machine Learning Algorithms.
The summary is presented in two notebooks, both of them explain when a scenario is categorized for being resolve through Semi Supervised Learning, these notebooks explain a mathematical intuition of the algorithms that can help us and how to implement them.
